# Soundcloud shortcomings
1. Soundcloud adds copyright strikes when someone tries to upload a remix of a licensed track
	- This sucks dick because 90% of the time, the uploader doesn't know the track is licensed.
	- We will use machine learning n shit to detect when a track is being illegally uploaded.
	- Rather than give them strikes like pussies, we'll let them know the track is licensed before they uplaod.
	- We can detect by track title, and by analyzing the track itself.

2. Laws involving remixes on copyrighted tracks suck dick to begin with.
	- Use all our business major friends to find loopholes in licensing.
	- End goal: you can upload remixes of any track at all, you just can't monetize copyrighted ones.

3. Soundcloud doesn't offer any aid to marketing your track after you upload.
	- We'll incorperate a pandora-style streaming service.
	- Likes/dislikes here reset daily.
	- More likes = higher probability to be played.
	- More dislikes = less probability to be played = possibility of being removed for the day.
	- The dislike feature filters out obvious troll songs and provide instant feedback to the artist.
	- Listeners now have the ability to hear fresh underground artists that they wouldn't be able to hear otherwise.
