## Soundcloud shortcomings
1. Soundcloud adds copyright strikes when someone tries to upload a remix of a licensed track
	- This sucks dick because 90% of the time, the uploader doesn't know the track is licensed.
	- We will use machine learning n shit to detect when a track is being illegally uploaded.
	- Rather than give them strikes like pussies, we'll let them know the track is licensed before they uplaod.
	- We can detect by track title, and by analyzing the track itself.

2. Laws involving remixes on copyrighted tracks suck dick to begin with.
	- Use all our business major friends to find loopholes in licensing.
	- End goal: you can upload remixes of any track at all, you just can't monetize copyrighted ones.

3. Soundcloud doesn't offer any aid to marketing your track after you upload.
	- We'll incorperate a pandora-style streaming service.
	- Likes/dislikes here reset daily.
	- More likes = higher probability to be played.
	- More dislikes = less probability to be played = possibility of being removed for the day.
	- The dislike feature filters out obvious troll songs and provide instant feedback to the artist.
	- Listeners now have the ability to hear fresh underground artists that they wouldn't be able to hear otherwise.

4. Soundcloud's UI kinda sucks
	- No dark mode, and no dark mode extensions in chrome or firefox that don't look like ass.
	- Simply providing something different may attract an audience.
	- I personally dig a minimal material look. We'll brainstorm ideas.
	- This is where the graphic design/frontend devs come in.

## Why contribute?
1. You have a project to contribute to for fun.
	- "Hey Mr. Job interviewer dude, look at this project I was a part of completely outside of school.
	- Projects outside of school arguably make you learn better than school projects do.

2. Learn good team project schools, as well as version control.
	- Two huge plusses in the eyes of a hiring team.

3. Possibly change the game for underground artists.
	- The streaming service could eliminate the need for an artist to have to market.
		- Marketing is over half of the battle to becoming a popular artist.
		- Marketing is impossible/extremely difficult if you aren't popular/wealthy to begin with.
		- Getting instant feedback is difficult if no one listens to your song.
	- By taking care of marketing, artists focus more on making better music.

## How can we make this happen?
1. Have UI/Frontend devs make the site look and feel like jizzing in a silk napkin.
2. Have A1 communication. We're a group of homies with no boss.
3. Backend devs focus on making bomb ass servers that serve shit better than anyone else.
4. Have really good commit messages, and branch from master whenever we wanna experiment.
5. We just do it. If it works, cool. If not, it was fun!
	- The skills we learn will benefit us in the long run anyway.
