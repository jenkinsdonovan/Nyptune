# Nyptune
* Meant to be an alternative to soundcloud

## Overview
This project is designed to provide an alternative service that builds upon and improves currently existing platforms for audio entertainment. The idea behind this type of software is to create a wide variety of implementations and functionalities that offer a better experience for both listeners and creators. The interest that sparked choosing such a design comes from various sources and many of us found the idea of building such a platform for users appealing. In particular, we were dissatisfied with the currently existing platforms for sharing music, and want to create a better alternative.

## Features
Nyptune will make use of database systems, and web based programming to implement a service revolving around user generated content. The objectives of Nyptune are as follows:
- Contain a database of musical tracks uploaded by users
- Allow intuitive and quick lookup of songs by various search categories
- Allow users to locate the content of other users easily
- Implement a radio-like system that satisfies the taste of each individual user
- Promote music to the user according to their tastes

## How can we make this happen?
1. Have UI/Frontend devs that create the best user experience possible.
2. Have a team with great communication..
3. Backend devs focus on a great backend system.
